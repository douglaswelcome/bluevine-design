# Scannable text

#### Long blocks of text are hard to read, especially on a wide screen. Users don’t read every word on the page: they scan. Make your copy as short as possible. Cut unnecessary words, and don’t mention anything that’s obvious from the interface or context.For scannable text:- Use bullets and numbered lists

  - Lists are easier to scan than blocks of text. They increase white space, deliver digestible chunks of information, and encourage you to trim your copy. See the style guide for list formats. - Place instructions in context

  - Instructions at the top of a form should be a few sentences at most. If your form requires more than that, consider using hint text in the form itself where necessary.
