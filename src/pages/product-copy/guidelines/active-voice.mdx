# Active voice

The active voice in product copy conveys a sense of forward progress that helps users complete tasks, while the passive voice often adds extra words that dilute the point and can confuse users. 

The active voice is direct and unconditional. For example: 

_Enter your password and click_ **_Log In_**

The passive voice is indirect and often conditional (if/when \_\_\_, do \_\_\_): 

_The_ **_Log In_** _button should be clicked when you have correctly entered your password._

Using the active voice offers several advantages, including:

- Fewer words
- More direct structure 
- Clear subject performing the action

Use the active voice for clear, direct copy that helps users complete tasks.
