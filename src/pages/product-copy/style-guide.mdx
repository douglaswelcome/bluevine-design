# Style Guide

## Referring to UI

When writing about UI elements (for example, in instructions), bold the element name, don’t use quotes, and avoid using the term for the UI element (button, link, tab, heading, etc.). Instead of using the term for the element, use the copy inside the element (

When instructions include using buttons or links, use _click_. Don’t use _click on, press_, or _hit_. 

For mobile and touch screen applications, use _tap_.

When referring to dropdown lists, use _list_ or _menu_: “Select a provider in the list.” Don’t use _dropdown_.


## Continue, next

Use _continue_ for sequential steps in a workflow (e.g., moving through multiple steps to set up an account).

Use _next_ for non-sequential items (e.g., moving from one transaction to another).


## Links

Link text should clearly indicate the destination or action (for tertiary Buttons). Use sentence case. “View profile”, not “Click here to view profile”


## Log in, login

Log in is 2 words when used as a verb: “You can also log in on your mobile device.” If using _to_, keep _in_ and _to_ separate: “Log in to your account”, not “Log into your account”

When using title case, capitalize both words: “Log In Now”, not “Log in Now”

_Login_ is 1 word when used as a noun or adjective. For instance: 

- Noun: “Reset your login.” 
- Adjective: “Follow the login instructions.”


## View, show

Use _view_ when the user’s context will change (for example, a modal or a new page will open): “View Payment”, “View Payee”

Use _show_ when the user’s display on the current page will change (for example, additional details or list items will appear):

| More items will be displayed                                                                               | Use a more/fewer toggleIf quantity is relevant, include a numerical indicator in parentheses.     | “Show more / Show fewer”“Show more (10) / Show fewer” |
| All items will be displayed                                                                                | Use an all/fewer toggleIf quantity is relevant, include the total number of items in parentheses. | “Show all / Show fewer”“Show all (18) / Show fewer”   |
| It’s not clear what will be displayed, or multiple types of information will be displayed on the same page | Include a noun in the toggle                                                                      | “Show all results / Show fewer results”               |


## Addressing users

Use _you_ in body text, introductions, and other descriptive copy: “To continue, enter your login information.”

Use the imperative voice to avoid _you_ in instructions: “Enter the shipping address”, not “You need to enter the shipping address”.
