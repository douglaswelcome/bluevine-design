# Guidelines

## Active voice

The active voice in product copy conveys a sense of forward progress that helps users complete tasks, while the passive voice often adds extra words that dilute the point and can confuse users. 

The active voice is direct and unconditional. For example: 

_Enter your password and click_ **_Log In_**

The passive voice is indirect and often conditional (if/when \_\_\_, do \_\_\_): 

_The_ **_Log In_** _button should be clicked when you have correctly entered your password._

Using the active voice offers several advantages, including:

- Fewer words
- More direct structure 
- Clear subject performing the action

Use the active voice for clear, direct copy that helps users complete tasks.


## Important info first

#### Figure out the most important words or details and put them first. To determine what’s most important, consider:- Where are users in the workflow?
- What have they just seen and experienced in previous steps?
- What do they need to know now?
- What’s their mindset at this moment?

## Scannable text

#### Long blocks of text are hard to read, especially on a wide screen. Users don’t read every word on the page: they scan. Make your copy as short as possible. Cut unnecessary words, and don’t mention anything that’s obvious from the interface or context.For scannable text:- Use bullets and numbered lists

  - Lists are easier to scan than blocks of text. They increase white space, deliver digestible chunks of information, and encourage you to trim your copy. See the style guide for list formats. - Place instructions in context

  - Instructions at the top of a form should be a few sentences at most. If your form requires more than that, consider using hint text in the form itself where necessary.
